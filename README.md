# SandP_500-algo_trade
A cleaner code is coming in the next update. <br>
It is better to download all the files if you want to run it.
I urge to spend some time to understand the code before using it.
Collected data from S &amp; P top 500 companies listed in NASDAQ and created investment strategies based on portfolio size. <br>
Thanks to https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/ for providing with the data. <br>
Thanks to FreeCodeCamp for provinding the IEX API CLOUD TOKEN. <br>
Only quant_trading.py needs to be run by the user. The other programs are not recommended to be run separately as the inputs have to be given via quant_trading.py file. <br>
Three different algorithmic trading strategies are discussed: Equal Weights Strategy, Quantitative Momentum Strategy and Quantitative Value Strategy <br>
For equal weights with individual requests, the data is collected only for 1st 100 results. <br>
For equal weights with specific, the value currently is set to 'AAPL'. Change the symbol in the equal_weights.py code as per your requirement. <br>
For momentum and value strategy currently mean and median can be chosen. <br>

Disclaimer: The data is not collected from cloud and hence it is not the actual/ realtime data. The data is collected from sandbox. So it cannot be used for making any real investment decisions. This is because the token used is free token. However, paid token can be brought from https://iexcloud.io/ based on user requirement.
